# The Writers

## Overview

### What is this site for?

The Writers is an online community for people who want to share their writing talents with the world and possibly win
some money while doing so.

### What does it do?

#### General users
The site allows users to register and log in. Once users are logged in they can post writings (posts), choosing whether
or not to make their posts public. Once a post is made public, other authenticated users are able to post comments on it.
Users are also allowed to vote for competition entries they think deserve to win.

#### Subscribed users
While subscribers enjoy the same privileges as general users, they also get the added benefit of entering their posts
in to competitions in which they can win a cash prize.

#### Competitions
Competitions are held on the site each month for subscribed users and consist of two time periods. An entry period in which subscribers can enter and a
voting period in which all users can vote. A user can not vote for the same entry twice. Once the voting period begins,
entries can not be edited but they can be deleted.

#### Winners
When the voting period ends the entry with the most votes wins the cash prize. The prize is calculated as 50% of the earnings
from subscriptions for that particular month.
